## Description

Elite Estate is a Spanish data analytics firm based on collecting and interpreting data from the housing market. This project aims to identify the most relevant variables affecting the price of houses and their specific impact on it. For carrying this out, the dataset ['houses_Madrid.csv'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/madrid-real-estate-market/) was thoroughly analysed. Then, diverse plots were designed for offering a grpahical representation of the data in order to facilitate the understanding of specific variables. To end, the program designed a price predictor using OOP programming, which it takes as input variables such as the number of rooms, bathrooms, square meters and the presence of a parking, and calculates the predicted price according to the data analysed.

## Installation & Usage

The program provides two ways for visualizing the code that contains the data analytics of Madrid's real estate market; from Google Collab or directly in Python.

- [Python installation](#PythonInstallation)
- [Google Collab instalation](#GoogleCollabInstallation)


### Python Installation
Firstly, install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

Once you have installed both programs you are ready to begin seeing Elite Estate analysis.

Download the 'requirements.txt' and the 'eliteestate.py' files. Save them in the same folder for better organisation.

Then, install the requirements in your Pycharm terminal.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The next step is the final one. Open the 'LanguageHUB.py' file which is the one containing the program. 

Run the code in the terminal and enjoy!

```python
python eliteestate.py
```

### Google Collab Installation

Download the 'EliteEstate.ipynb' file and have it located

After this, you will need to visit [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) and sign in and upload the 'EliteEstate.ipynb' document to 'Your Drive'. 

Once the file is uploaded, click on it to open it.

From here, run the cells in their respective order and you will be able to see the abalysis carried out.
